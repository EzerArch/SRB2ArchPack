Thank you for downloading ArchPack version 1.0, an addon created for the fangame SRB2, Sonic Robo Blast 2 (http://www.srb2.org). I hope you enjoy playing this level pack.

The development of this level pack started on July 2008, when I released my first map called Miscellaneous Trip Zone. All my released maps are included in this level pack.

--- Launching SRB2 with ArchPack ---

Firstly, the file scmrtf_archpack.wad must be in SRB2 folder or any folder within the SRB2 folder, and then, start up SRB2 with ArchPack by one of the following ways:

1) Manual loading: start up SRB2, open the console (see http://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Console) and type ADDFILE scmrtf_archpack.wad and hit Enter. The level pack will be loaded.

2) Or, using a quick launcher: use one of the provided batch files to start up standard SRB2, XSRB2 or SRB2CB (in OpenGL) with ArchPack.

Once the ArchPack is loaded, use the game menu to start or host a new game, and you're done.


--- Savegame, Statistics, Time Attack and Secrets ---

This level pack is capable of recording savegames (ssg files), statistics (dat files) and time attacks which are accessible via game menu, option "1 Player". 

NOTICE: Time Attacks from older versions of ArchPack may be incompatible with this version.

No secrets or unlockables of any kind were included in this level pack.
