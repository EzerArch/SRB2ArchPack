# Configuration File for ArchPack
# File: scmrtf_archpack.wad
# Author: Ezer'Arch
# Release date: July 14, 2013
# Version Build: 2.0 Stable

# ==== Notes ====
# v2.0 change log:
#   - ADD: General - unlockables.
#   - ADD: General - 15 emblems, 1st and 2nd act maps and MTZ have got 3 emblems each map.
#   - ADD: New map - Genesis Keep Zone Act 1 (GKZ1).
#   - ADD: New map - Genesis Keep Zone Act 2 (GKZ2).
#   - ADD: New map - Genesis Keep Zone Act 3 (GKZ3).
#   - ADD: New map - Soccer Field Zone (SFZ) is back as unlockable.
#   - CHANGE: General - tumbleweed sprites were replaced to make SFZ ball. See SOC section below.
#   - CHANGE: General - total number of emerald tokens is now 9.
#   - CHANGE: General - single player maps were renumbered. Old savegames, statistics, time-attacks are unsupported.
#   - CHANGE: MCZ2 - minor changes in the left path's 1st room. A few crates were moved and the path next to the exit enlarged.
#   - CHANGE: MTZ - emerald tokens removed.
#   - FIX: MCZ1 - wrong FOF height in the first room.
# 
# Known issues:
# 1) I know there are some hall-of-mirrors in GKZ2. I'll try to fix them for the next release, if possible.
# 2) There is a bug in the emblems/unlockable system, vanilla unlockables "leak" into this mod, and it counts more emblems than it is supposed to.
#
# General:
#   - This level pack comes with a readme.txt, more details can be found there too.
