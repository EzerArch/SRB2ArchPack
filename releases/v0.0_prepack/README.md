About this directory
=============

Here are the original maps submitted for Official Level Design Contest (https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Official_Level_Design_Contest) and other stuff prior to the 1st release of SRB2 ArchPack (i.e. version 0.1).


Required version
-------------

* Version 1.09.4: all maps, except the below.
* Version 2.0.x: Mill Citadel Zone 3, Lift Bridge v2 and Mill Citadel Act 2 v2 beta3 (to confirm).


A bit about the content
-------------

* FirstMap: the map I made while following the SRB2 Doom Builder tutorial (https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/SRB2_Doom_Builder_tutorial) likely in June 2008. The name is still Greenflower because back then I didn't know how to edit level headers. Never included in ArchPack, it's here for "curiosity" purposes to show that mappers can start small.

* MiscRealm: the 1st public maps posted on SRB2 Message Board. It was made mostly as pratice and experiment after following the SRB2 Doom Builder tutorial.

* Others except LiftBridge2.0 and MillCitadel_act3: maps for OLDC.

* LiftBridge2.0: an update that added beaches and a few changes (based on feedback)

* And a few finds and more. You can tell what is what by directory and file names. Or just open them, they won't bite.

Maybe more to come.
