--- Savegame, Statistics, Time Attack and Secrets ---

This level pack records savegames, statistics (gamedata), emeralds and emblems collected and time attacks which are accessible through game menu, option "1 Player".

NOTICE: Time attacks from older versions of ArchPack are incompatible with this version.

The single player maps have 9 special stages tokens in total. Each special stage token will allow you to enter a special stage that, if beaten, will award you with a Chaos Emerald.  

This level pack features two unlockables:

1) Vanilla Maps: Clear game at least once. After the credits, it gives you access to vanilla SRB2 maps.

2) Soccer field: Collect 15 emblems and beat the game in 8 minutes. It gives you access to a map that is a soccer field with a ball. This map has no other purpose than a casual gameplay or curiosity.

MULTIPLAYER:
- This map is multiplayer compatible for co-op, match and tag. To access it, type MAP MAPME in the console.
