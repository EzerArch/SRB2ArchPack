Thank you for downloading ArchPack version 2.1, an addon created for the fangame SRB2, Sonic Robo Blast 2 (http://www.srb2.org). I hope you enjoy playing this level pack.

The development of this level pack started on July 2008, when I released my first map called Miscellaneous Trip Zone. All my released maps are included in this pack.

--- What's new? ---

ArchPack v2.1 change log (2013.07.14):

   - ADD: General - unlockables.
   - ADD: General - 15 emblems, 1st and 2nd act maps and MTZ have got 3 emblems each map.
   - ADD: New map - Genesis Keep Zone Act 1 (GKZ1).
   - ADD: New map - Genesis Keep Zone Act 2 (GKZ2).
   - ADD: New map - Genesis Keep Zone Act 3 (GKZ3).
   - ADD: New map - Soccer Field Zone (SFZ) is back as unlockable.
   - CHANGE: General - tumbleweed sprites were replaced to make SFZ ball. See SOC section below.
   - CHANGE: General - total number of emerald tokens is now 9.
   - CHANGE: General - single player maps were renumbered. Old savegames, statistics, time-attacks are unsupported.
   - CHANGE: MCZ2 - minor changes in the left path's 1st room. A few crates were moved and the path next to the exit enlarged.
   - CHANGE: MTZ - emerald tokens removed.
   - FIX: MCZ1 - wrong FOF height in the first room.

 Known issues:
 1) I know there are some hall-of-mirrors in GKZ2. I'll try to fix them for the next release, if possible.
 2) There is a bug in the emblems/unlockable system, vanilla unlockables "leak" into this mod, and it counts more emblems than it is supposed to.

--- Savegame, Statistics, Time Attack and Secrets ---

This level pack records savegames, statistics (gamedata), emeralds and emblems collected and time attacks which are accessible through game menu, option "1 Player".

NOTICE: Time attacks from older versions of ArchPack are incompatible with this version.

The single player maps have 9 special stages tokens in total. Each special stage token will allow you to enter a special stage that, if beaten, will award you with a Chaos Emerald.  

This level pack features two unlockables:

1) Vanilla Maps: Clear game at least once. After the credits, it gives you access to vanilla SRB2 maps.

2) Soccer field: Collect 15 emblems and beat the game in 8 minutes. It gives you access to a map that is a soccer field with a ball. This map has no other purpose than a casual gameplay.
MULTIPLAYER:
- This map is multiplayer compatible for co-op, match and tag. To access it, type MAP MAPC4 in the console.
- If you host a server with this map, make sure to host it on Casual Room (see http://ms.srb2.org).
