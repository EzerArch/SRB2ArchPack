[B]ArchPack[/B] is a level pack addon for SRB2 with single player and multiplayer maps, including my very first map called Miscellaneous Trip Zone released on July 2008, back when SRB2 1.09.4 was still around. All my released and finished maps are included in this pack.

The version 2.1 is a straight port from SRB2 2.0.6 to 2.1.8 (works with 2.1.10 as well) which I offer to give more options for those who would like to try short level packs with old maps.

This pack comes with launchers and a [B][I]readme.txt[/I][/B] with more details. This pack, unfinished maps and other material can be found on my [URL="https://github.com/EzerArch/SRB2ArchPack"]GitHub[/URL].
